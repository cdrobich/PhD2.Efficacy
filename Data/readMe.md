## PhD Chapter 2 Data

Data collected from Long Point peninsula and Rondeau Provincial Park following a Before-After-Control-Impact regression design

  * 40 sites in Long Point, 40 sites in Rondeau
  
  * 40 sites in control (no treatment, dense Phragmites) and 40 sites in treatment (glyphosate-based herbicide)
    * all sites were paired along water depth gradient in 2016 (10 - 48 cm)
    
  * Sites were visited in 2016 before treatment and in 2017 and 2018 one- and two- years after treatment
  
  * Sites are all 1 m^2
  
  * Collected water depth (cm), canopy height (cm), density of living Phragmites stems (per m^2) and total Phragmites stems (per m^2),
    community composition, and percent incident light
    
  * 2016 accidental spray of site (RPC16 I think?) so recoded as "Treatment" (n = 41); 2018 could not reach RPC40 (I think?)
