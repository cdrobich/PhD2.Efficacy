# Scripts associated with the analyses

1. BACI_ANOVAs - two-way ANOVAs for live stem density, total stem density, canopy height, incident light; results and figures

2. LiveStems_ANCOVA - comparison of density of live stems in control and treated sites along the water depth, one year after treatment

3. Euclidean_distances_ANOVA - one-way ANOVAs on the Euclidean distances b/w treatment sites and control centroid, emergent marsh centroid, and meadow marsh centroid. Distances are calculated based on NMDS co-ordinates
