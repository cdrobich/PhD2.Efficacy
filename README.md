# PhD Thesis: Chapter 2

1. How does glyphosate-based herbicide treatment affect Phragmites australis density along a water depth gradient?

2. How do treated sites move in species space relative to a control (no treatment, dense Phragmites) centroid and two "reference" centroids representing meadow marsh and emergent marsh?
